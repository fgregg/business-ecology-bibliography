	abstract = {This paper attempts to reconcile the sociocultural and neoclassical approaches to human ecology. The sociocultural frame of reference emphasizes individual action. It has proven effective in studying phenomena such as land use within a city, but its effectiveness for studying properties of entire populations has not been demonstrated. The ecological complex is a frame of reference designed to study properties of populations. These two frames of reference are complementary rather than contradictory. The sociocultural approach is a microecological approach and the neoclassical approach is a macroecological approach. One can demonstrate the complementarity of these approaches by moving between the micro and macro levels of analysis.},

Part I contains articles by leading sociologists and geographers tracing the history of the field from its beginning in 1921 and reconciling conflicting current conceptions. Part II presents social ecology as a framework for studying the city with respect to ethnicity, neighborhood organization, mental illness, and commuting patterns. Part III offers comparative studies from Latin America, Europe, and Asia. An introduction by the editor provides a critical overview to each part.},
