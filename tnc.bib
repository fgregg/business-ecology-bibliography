	abstract = {One of the classic questions in urban sociology is how social relations and solidarity are maintained in an urbanized, industrialized, bureaucratic society. The two pivotal research focuses have been the issues of (1) the persistence of territorially based affective ties and primary relations in an urban world and (2) the micro/macro links connecting community residents and the larger society. This article argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating themselves with others who share their values and preferences and asserting their social status and social identity to others.},

	abstract = {Using newly available data, simple measures, and recently developed spatial analysis techniques, this paper addresses the following questions: 1) What are the general patterns of growth and decline in United States urban settlements from early in the twentieth century through 2000? 2) How varied are the patterns found? Do they vary by urban area or by period? 3) For three major metropolises in the United States, is the pattern of growth similar over the entire history of each city? How are they different or similar? Relying upon the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) data for census tracts from 1910 to 2000, this paper uses comparable data to assess patterns of growth in all urban areas with available data in the United States. Findings indicate that cities grew away from their centres in the early decades, but growth was more patterned in Chicago and Los Angeles than in the New York area. Later, growth and decline coexisted in similar zones; by 2000, no patterning was apparent in any of the three major metropolises. Implications are drawn for further research.},
