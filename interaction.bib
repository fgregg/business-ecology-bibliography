	abstract = {Previous models of urban residential segregation have virtually ignored the affects of tertiary, or small, residential{\textendash}type streets, despite the intuition that they are where {\textquotedblleft}neighborly{\textquotedblright} relations primarily occur. This article argues that racial similarity among neighborhoods emerges primarily from their relational connections via tertiary streets rather than as a result of geographic proximity. Analyzing tertiary streets can better predict racial composition than can spatial considerations. Segregated networks of neighborly relations emerge from segregated networks of residential streets. Racial populations are organized in space with respect to who is {\textquotedblleft}down the street{\textquotedblright} rather than in terms of mere physical distance.},

	abstract = {Some segregation results from the practices of organizations, some from specialized communication systems, some from correlation with a variable that is non-random; and some results from the interplay of individual choices. This is an abstract study of the interactive dynamics of discriminatory individual choices. One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to {\textquoteleft}neighborhood tipping.{\textquoteright} The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of {\textquoteleft}tipping{\textquoteright} begins to emerge.},

The text considers the economics of cities as a whole, instead of separating them. Emphasis is placed on economic theory and empirical studies that are based in economic theory. The book also explores the policy lessons that can be drawn from the use of economics to understand urban areas. Real estate professionals will find new coverage of urban areas around the world to provide a global perspective.},

	isbn = {9780262016360},
	abstract = {Lectures on Urban Economics offers a rigorous but nontechnical treatment of major topics in urban economics. To make the book accessible to a broad range of readers, the analysis is diagrammatic rather than mathematical. Although nontechnical, the book relies on rigorous economic reasoning. In contrast to the cursory theoretical development often found in other textbooks, Lectures on Urban Economics offers thorough and exhaustive treatments of models relevant to each topic, with the goal of revealing the logic of economic reasoning while also teaching urban economics. Topics covered include reasons for the existence of cities, urban spatial structure, urban sprawl and land-use controls, freeway congestion, housing demand and tenure choice, housing policies, local public goods and services, pollution, crime, and quality of life. Footnotes throughout the book point to relevant exercises, which appear at the back of the book. These 22 extended exercises (containing 125 individual parts) develop numerical examples based on the models analyzed in the chapters. Lectures on Urban Economics is suitable for undergraduate use, as background reading for graduate students, or as a professional reference for economists and scholars interested in the urban economics perspective.},
