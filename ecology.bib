It has proven effective in studying phenomena such as land use within a city, but its effectiveness for studying properties of entire populations has not been demonstrated. The ecological complex is a frame of reference designed to study properties of populations. These two frames of reference are complementary rather than contradictory. The sociocultural approach is a microecological approach and the neoclassical approach is a macroecological approach. One can demonstrate the complementarity of these approaches by moving between the micro and macro levels of analysis.},

Part II presents social ecology as a framework for studying the city with respect to ethnicity, neighborhood organization, mental illness, and commuting patterns.

But ambiguities in Fischer's subcultural theory require clarification before its validity can be thoroughly judged. Ironically, a few of these conceptual problems may have led to underestimating the theory's plausibility. Recent empirical research is typically consistent with subcultural theory but includes important failures and significant gaps. Clearer theoretical specification should enable researchers to better test subcultural theory and decide among different explanations of urbanism's social implications.},

In this detailed study, the author demonstrates that much of the manifold variation in the social characteristics of populations living in different parts of the city may be summarized in terms of a small number of factors relating to social rank, style of life preferences and ethnicity. Residential and social differentiation are seen as intimately connected. At the individual level, it is suggested that questions relating to social rank, style of life, and ethnicity provide the main framework for the choice of residential location. At the societal level, it is suggested that the variations in the inter-relationship of the basic differentiating factors are a function of modernization. Empirical material is drawn from an number of Australian cities.},

The book had its genesis in a conference held at Cornell University in the fall of 1990 that was organized by Dudley Poston, Paul Eberts, and Michael Hannan, all professors at the time at Cornell. With the very generous financial assistance of David Call, then the dean of Cornell's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Poston, Eberts, and Hannan put together a two-day conference oflectures and papers by human ecologists from Cornell University and elsewhere. The conference focused on sociological human ecology and celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Amos Hawley's Human Ecology (Ronald Press 1950). Professor Hawley was the keynote speaker at the conference. Many of the authors of the chapters in this volume presented earlier versions at the Cornell conference in 1990. Cornell's Departments of Rural Sociology and Sociology also contrib uted financial assistance; however, without Dean Call's very generous support, the conference would not have been possible. A few months after the conference, Poston and Michael Micklin discussed the possibility of asking the various authors of the Cornell conference papers to revise them for publication in a volume on sociological human ecology. Many opted to do so, but others did not because of time and other kinds of commitments and constraints.},

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.},

To make the book accessible to a broad range of readers, the analysis is diagrammatic rather than mathematical. Although nontechnical, the book relies on rigorous economic reasoning. In contrast to the cursory theoretical development often found in other textbooks, Lectures on Urban Economics offers thorough and exhaustive treatments of models relevant to each topic, with the goal of revealing the logic of economic reasoning while also teaching urban economics. Topics covered include reasons for the existence of cities, urban spatial structure, urban sprawl and land-use controls, freeway congestion, housing demand and tenure choice, housing policies, local public goods and services, pollution, crime, and quality of life. Footnotes throughout the book point to relevant exercises, which appear at the back of the book. These 22 extended exercises (containing 125 individual parts) develop numerical examples based on the models analyzed in the chapters. Lectures on Urban Economics is suitable for undergraduate use, as background reading for graduate students, or as a professional reference for economists and scholars interested in the urban economics perspective.},

The two pivotal research focuses have been the issues of (1) the persistence of territorially based affective ties and primary relations in an urban world and (2) the micro/macro links connecting community residents and the larger society. This article argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating themselves with others who share their values and preferences and asserting their social status and social identity to others.},

Do they vary by urban area or by period? 3) For three major metropolises in the United States, is the pattern of growth similar over the entire history of each city? How are they different or similar? Relying upon the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) data for census tracts from 1910 to 2000, this paper uses comparable data to assess patterns of growth in all urban areas with available data in the United States. Findings indicate that cities grew away from their centres in the early decades, but growth was more patterned in Chicago and Los Angeles than in the New York area. Later, growth and decline coexisted in similar zones; by 2000, no patterning was apparent in any of the three major metropolises. Implications are drawn for further research.},
